SAX: Process XML data and do something useful with it
=====================================================
SAXParserFactory: Generates a SAXParser instance.
SAXParser: Object that does the parsing
SAXReader
DefaultHandler: Defines the class that will handle the SAX events that the parser generates
	public class DefaultHandler implements ContentHandler, DTDHandler, EntityHandler, ErrorHandler{}
ContentHandler: Implemented by DefaultHandler, so rather than implementing this interface directly, extend DefaultHandler.
	Requires methods that the SAX parser invokes in response to various parsing events. 
	Major eventhandling methods are: startDocument, endDocument, startElement, endElement.
	All these methods must throw SAXException
	The JAXP SAX API also allows you to handle the characters that the parser delivers to your application, 
		using the ContentHandler.characters() method.
ErrorHandler
DTDHandler
EntityResolver

XMLReader: The XMLReader is used by the application to tell the SAX parser what processing it is to perform on 
	the document in question.
