SAX
---
Simple API for XML
Sequential reading of XML files. Can not be used to create XML documents.

SAX provides an Event-Driven XML Processing following the Push-Parsing Model. What this model means is that 
in SAX, Applications will register Listeners in the form of Handlers to the Parser and will get notified 
through Call-back methods. Here the SAX Parser takes the control over Application thread by Pushing Events to 
the Application.


Stax (Streaming API for XML)
----
Streaming API for XML, simply called StaX, is an API for reading and writing XML Documents. 
Introduced in Java 6.0 and considered as superior to SAX and DOM

JAXB
----
Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB)
JAXB is a Java standard that defines how Java objects are converted to/from XML (specified using a standard 
set of mappings. JAXB defines a programmer API for reading and writing Java objects to / from XML documents 
and a service provider which / from from XML documents allows the selection of the JAXB implementation

JAXB applies a lot of defaults thus making reading and writing of XML via Java very easy.
